# multi-language-primes

**** A WORK IN PROGRESS ****
**** WILL REMOVE WHEN YOUTUBE VIDEO IS DONE ****

A newbie's attempt at benchmarking with data, my personal purpose is at the bottom

Purpose of this repo: Being new to the programming and software world, my goal is to explore several programming languages.  By doing this I can see how fast I can make a shitload of data and do pointless things with said data. Another item I'm hoping to touch on is the outside help I've gotten on the way  

Current Language list:
I know or are familiar enough to get done in a normal adult night:
- Python
- Go 
- Javascript
- Rust
  
Future Plans Languages:
Need some to do some learning or a big refresher:
- C++  (C++98 standards were the last time I used C++ :()
- PHP? (im just going off a list i found, I used to make websites in it... a while ago)
- Typescript (yes i know it might just be the same thing as javascript)
- OCAML (People like it)
- Haskell (Need to grow out neckbeard)
- Java (CS 101, in the early 2000s OOF) 

I'm missing a few im sure, up for suggestions, or would like to contribute? (not sure if im allowing others right now, i want to learn) 

Table of Arbitray Things:
1. Generate a ton of prime numbers
2. See how long it takes
3. Pass judgement on different programming languages (kidding... but really?)
4. Conclusion - Who WON!?

1. Generate a ton of prime numbers
   a. different algorithms and use the fastest of them all.
