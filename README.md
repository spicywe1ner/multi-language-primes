# multi-language-primes

**** A WORK IN PROGRESS - WILL REMOVE WHEN YOUTUBE VIDEO IS DONE ****

NOTE: I dont understand github mark up language yet. so I apologize if its ugly until I can fix it

Table of Arbitray Things:
1. Generate a ton of prime numbers with python
2. See how long it takes
3. Pass judgement on different programming languages (kidding... but really?)
4. General Project Overview

1. Generate a ton of prime numbers with python - trying to keep data under 10 minutes run time
  a. Standard Number Amount, Number of Primes.  I have them stored in an array
    - 10,000
    - 20,000
    - 30,000
    - 40,000
    - 50,000
    - 100,000
    - 200,000
    - 300,000
    - 400,000
    - 500,000
    - 1,000,000 (about 7m in python currently)
  b. just one run of able to average data (I haven't seen any significant deviation in any test 
  c. Simple nothing else to worry about here.

2. Timing
  a. Done in seconds
  b. Total might only hold relevance between code
  c. Plot the data, to see if anonymolies happen.

3. Comparisons, Will see update when data shows up from other languages

4. General Overview:

  A newbie's attempt at benchmarking with data, my personal purpose is at the bottom

  Purpose of this repo: Being new to the programming and software world, my goal is to explore several programming languages.  By doing this I   can see how fast I can make a shitload of data and do pointless things with said data. Another item I'm hoping to touch on is the outside help I've gotten on the way  

  Current Language list:
  I know or are familiar enough to get done in a normal adult night:
    - Python (already done, just standardizing)
    - Go (in prog)
    - Javascript (starting next)
    - Rust (welp, I'll get to it)
  
  Future Plans Languages:
  Need some to do some learning or a big refresher:
    - C++  (C++98 standards were the last time I used C++ :()
    - PHP? (im just going off a list i found, I used to make websites in it... a while ago)
    - Typescript (yes i know it might just be the same thing as javascript)
    - OCAML (People like it)
    - Haskell (Need to grow out neckbeard)
    - Java (CS 101, in the early 2000s OOF) 

  I'm missing a few im sure, up for suggestions, or would like to contribute? As I complete the tasks, if you can do better, I would love to see it. Learning by collaboration.  I'm sure a lot of the readers will be able to EASILY do this, and grossly out perform my code.
